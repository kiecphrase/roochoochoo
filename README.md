silly little pwa to organize with friends

## to do

- get the pwa part working
  - find the origional pwa tutorial I used 2 years ago
- get the basics of the page set up
- determine data strategy
  - could do cookies maybe depending on how caching would work offline
  - maybe do a json
  - possibly do a sqlite db? probably overkill
- MVP
  - get total schedule
  - get a way to set what you want to see
  - get a way to share what your schedule is
    - json, iso, something else
- Stretch:
  - make it pretty
  - user customization?
