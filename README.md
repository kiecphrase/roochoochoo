silly little pwa to organize with friends

## general idea

Utilize the power of pwa and basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make a functional-enough app that can be downloaded on any mobile device. This allows individuals to help map out their Roo experience and organize with friends


## to do

- get the pwa part working
  - find the origional pwa tutorial I used 2 years ago (done)
- get the basics of the page set up (done with js, css, general html)
- determine data strategy
  - could do cookies maybe depending on how caching would work offline
  - maybe do a json
  - possibly do a sqlite db? probably overkill
- MVP
  - get total schedule
  - get a way to set what you want to see
  - get a way to share what your schedule is
    - json, iso, something else
- Stretch:
  - make it pretty (done?)
  - user customization?
